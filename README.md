## 📚 Contents

The main notebook covers:
- **Introduction & Problem Statement:** Overview of diabetes, motivation, and objectives.
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing:** Importing the dataset, handling missing values, outlier analysis, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Summary statistics, correlations, visualizations (histograms, boxplots, pairplots) to gain insights into the data/distribution.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying significant features using statistical tests and correlation analysis.
- **Model Building & Evaluation:**
  - **Classification Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
  - **Model Training & Testing:** Splitting data, fitting models, predictions.
  - **Performance Metrics:** Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC curve.
- **Result Interpretation:** Analyzing feature importances, discussing what drives predictions.
- **Risk Analysis:** Assessing individual/patient-level risk factors and model explainability.
- **Visualizations:** Charts, graphs, and confusion matrices, including correlation matrix and feature importance plots.
- **Conclusion & Future Work:** Summarizing findings and laying out next steps.

## 🗂 Dataset

- **Source:** (Add source, e.g., [Kaggle Diabetes Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/diabetes-data-set), UCI Machine Learning Repository, or your own data)
- **Features:** (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI, Age, DiabetesPedigreeFunction, Outcome, etc.)

Add a note if you must download data manually or place it in a certain folder.

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/RAHUL04012006/Diabetes-prediction-and-risk-analysis.git
    cd Diabetes-prediction-and-risk-analysis
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

3. Open the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook "Diabetes_Project_Final_Organized (2).ipynb"
    ```

4. Download the dataset if needed and place it in the directory.

## 🚀 Usage

- Run each cell sequentially to perform data loading, EDA, modeling, and risk analysis.
- Interpret results and plots to understand important predictors and diagnose risk for diabetes.

## 📊 Results

Example Results (please update with your actual findings):
- **Best Model:** (e.g., Random Forest)
- **Accuracy:** ~XX% on test data
- **Top Predictors:** Glucose, BMI, Age, etc.
- **Major Insights:** (Add summary bullets on findings, e.g., "High glucose levels, BMI, and age are top predictors for diabetes risk.")
